/**
 * Adapts the editor's metrics carousel to [DockableContent] so it can float over other apps
 * (ADFA-5486).
 *
 * The window rebinds the editor's own [MetricsCarouselController] rather than building a second
 * one. Only one carousel can be live at a time -- the watchers hold a single listener each -- so
 * undocking moves the carousel out of the editor rather than copying it, which is also how an
 * editor file tab undocks. The editor shows a "tap to bring them back" message in the space it
 * vacates.
 *
 * The sample history is unaffected by the move: the watchers own it, so the carousel is redrawn in
 * full wherever it is bound.
 *
 * @property controller The carousel to rebind into this window.
 * @property title Window title, resolved by the caller against the IDE's resources.

	 * The bookshelf, grouped into categories, for the `bookshelf` template's JSON context.
	 *
	 * Assembled here rather than by SQLite's JSON1 functions (ADFA-5179): `JSON_OBJECT` and

	 * on Android 13 among them -- where the old query failed at runtime with `no such function:
	 * JSON_OBJECT` and the bookshelf could not be opened at all. A plain relational query and gson
	 * work everywhere.
	 *
	 * The payload keeps its keys, nesting and explicit nulls, but two things about it do change, both
	 * deliberately:
	 *
	 * Books within a category are now genuinely sorted by title. The old `ORDER BY BC.category,
	 * B.title` was inert for them -- it ordered the *groups*, while `JSON_GROUP_ARRAY` aggregated
	 * rows in scan order, and `B.title` was a bare column under `GROUP BY BC.category`. Against the
	 * shipped database this reverses the two Java books: "Java, Java, Java" came first by insertion,
	 * and "Java Notes for Professionals" comes first by title (a space sorts before a comma).
	 * Deterministic order is worth having, but it is a visible change, not a no-op.
	 *
	 * A category whose books all have a NULL `Content.path` disappears from the page. The old query
	 * emitted the section with `"link": null` in it -- visibly broken, but present -- because the JSON
	 * was built per row before any filtering. Here the row is skipped before its group is created, so
	 * an entire category can vanish with only a log line to say so. Skipping a row that cannot be
	 * linked is still right; the section going with it is the part worth knowing.
	 *
	 * The `pdf` flag is now case-insensitive. `SUBSTR(C.path, -4) == '.pdf'` compared under BINARY
	 * collation, so a row at `books/Guide.PDF` was flagged 0 and rendered as a web link. No shipped
	 * row spells the extension any other way -- checked with `GLOB '*.[Pp][Dd][Ff]'` -- so nothing
	 * changes today; a future upper-case path is simply treated as the PDF it is.
	 *
	 * An empty bookshelf comes back as an empty list, which the template renders as an empty page.
	 * The old query turned that case into an HTTP 500: `group_concat` over no rows is NULL, so the
	 * concatenated JSON was NULL and reading it as a blob threw. Worth knowing, because the rows in
	 * at least one `documentation.db` copy have a NULL `bookCategoryID` and so join to nothing.

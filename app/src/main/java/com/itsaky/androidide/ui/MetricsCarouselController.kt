 * Split out of the editor activity so the carousel can be hosted somewhere else -- specifically a
 * floating window, once ADFA-5486's undocking lands. The host supplies a binding to bind to and the
 * watchers to read from; everything else about running a carousel lives here.
 *
 * Only one controller may be live at a time. [MemoryUsageWatcher] and [NetworkUsageWatcher] each
 * hold a single listener, so a second carousel would silently take the updates from the first --
 * which is why undocking has to move the carousel out of the editor rather than copy it there.
 *
 * @param lineColorFor Supplies the plot colour for a watched process. Passed in because the process

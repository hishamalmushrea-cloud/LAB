/**
 * A [LineChart] that guards its [onDraw] against the MPAndroidChart axis-rendering race.
 *
 * MPAndroidChart is not thread-safe: [com.github.mikephil.charting.renderer.AxisRenderer.computeAxisValues]
 * writes `mEntryCount` and reallocates the `mEntries` array in two separate statements. When the view is
 * drawn from more than one thread at once, a reader can observe the new `mEntryCount` while `mEntries` is
 * still the old (shorter) array, throwing an [IndexOutOfBoundsException] from the label renderer.
 *
 * This happens in AndroidIDE because Sentry Session Replay (the SDK feature we use to report to
 * GlitchTip) records the screen by drawing the view
 * hierarchy on a background thread, which races the main-thread updates of the memory-usage chart. The
 * chart is a non-critical diagnostic view, so dropping the occasional frame is preferable to crashing the
 * whole IDE. The next `invalidate()` recovers cleanly.

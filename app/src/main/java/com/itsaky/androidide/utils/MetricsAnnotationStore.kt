/**
 * Records significant events for the metrics charts to annotate (ADFA-5486).
 *
 * Significant means Gradle task starts and stops, and a build's own start and outcome
 * (ADFA-5509). A real build emits far too many task events to draw -- dozens a second during
 * configuration -- so those are throttled to at most one every [THROTTLE_INTERVAL_MS]. The first
 * event in a quiet period is the one kept, since the interesting moment is when work *began*, not
 * an arbitrary one from the middle of a burst. Build outcomes are never throttled and are the last
 * thing evicted; see [Kind.isThrottled] and [record].
 *
 * Annotations are stored by wall-clock time rather than by sample position, because the charts hold
 * a ring buffer whose contents shift under them; a stored index would drift. The renderer converts
 * a timestamp to an x position from its age, and anything older than the buffer falls off.

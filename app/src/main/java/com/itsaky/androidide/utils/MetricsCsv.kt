/**
 * The canonical metrics file: everything the carousel has sampled, as CSV (ADFA-5531).
 *
 * One definition, because the file has several producers and consumers -- the export button here,
 * ADFA-5494's restore across process death, and the copies ADFA-5526 and ADFA-5534 attach to crash
 * reports and to feedback. Those differ from this only in compressing it.
 *
 * A row is a sampling tick, and its columns come from three watchers that each keep their own ring
 * buffer and their own coroutine. They are started together and share one interval, and every one
 * of them is cleared when that interval changes. The row's stated time is the memory watcher's,
 * recorded when it sampled, and nothing here reconstructs a time from an index.
 *
 * The other series are paired to that row by array index rather than by time, which is not the same
 * thing. Each watcher runs its own loop and does its own per-tick work, so their ticks drift apart,
 * and because the buffers are filled oldest-first the drift accumulates backwards: the further back
 * a row is, the further its network and power values can sit from its stated time. Every column is
 * a real reading with a real time behind it, so nothing in the file is invented -- but a consumer
 * must not read one row as three simultaneous measurements. Merging the series on time instead is
 * the subject of its own change; this comment says what is true until then.
 *
 * Formatting only, with no Android types, so the whole format can be tested without a device.

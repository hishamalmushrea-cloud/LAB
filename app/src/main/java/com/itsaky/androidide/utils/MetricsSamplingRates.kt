 * The sampling rates the metrics charts offer, and which of them a given device may use

 *
 * Sampling costs a `Debug.getMemoryInfo` call per watched process plus two `TrafficStats` reads,
 * every interval. At the fastest rate that is ten times a second, which on weak hardware is enough
 * to distort the very thing the chart is measuring. 32-bit devices are therefore held to a slower
 * floor than 64-bit ones.
 *
 * Rates a device cannot use are still listed, marked unavailable, rather than hidden -- a chooser
 * that silently omits them leaves the user wondering whether the IDE simply cannot sample faster.
 * [Rate.isAvailable] is what a chooser should grey out; [minimumIntervalMillis] is the floor it
 * enforces.

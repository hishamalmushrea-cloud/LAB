 * the file: the feedback FAB can be tapped with the strip closed (ADFA-5534), and a crash report is
 * assembled with no UI at all (ADFA-5526).
 *
 * Every read here takes the watcher's own history lock, so this is safe from any thread -- which it
 * has to be, because a crash arrives on whatever thread threw (ADFA-5526). Formatting and writing
 * are a different matter and must stay off the main thread.

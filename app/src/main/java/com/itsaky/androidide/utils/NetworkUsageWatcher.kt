/**
 * Samples this app's network traffic (ADFA-5489).
 *
 * Accounting is UID-level, not per socket: [TrafficStats.getUidRxBytes] and
 * [TrafficStats.getUidTxBytes] cover every process sharing the app's UID, which is what makes
 * Gradle's downloads show up here -- the Gradle Tooling and daemon processes share it. No socket
 * tagging is involved, so there is deliberately no per-feature breakdown.
 *
 * The platform counters are cumulative since boot, so what is recorded is the *delta* between
 * consecutive samples: bytes transferred during that interval. A sampler that reported the raw
 * counters would draw a monotonically rising line that says nothing about current activity.
 *
 * @param updateInterval Milliseconds between samples.
 * @param uid The UID to account for. Defaults to this process's own; injectable for tests.
 * @param readRxBytes Reads the cumulative received byte count. Injectable for tests.
 * @param readTxBytes Reads the cumulative transmitted byte count. Injectable for tests.

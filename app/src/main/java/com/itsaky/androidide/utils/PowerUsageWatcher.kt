/**
 * Samples the device's temperature and power draw (ADFA-5499).
 *
 * What a normally-installed app can read is narrower than it sounds. Battery temperature and the
 * current/voltage pair behind power come from the battery, free of any permission. The per-zone CPU
 * and skin temperatures the platform itself can see need `android.permission.DEVICE_POWER`, which is
 * signature-level and cannot be granted to an installed app at all -- hence [PowerSource], so a
 * privileged build could supply better readings without the chart changing.
 *
 * Power is instantaneous rather than cumulative: a running total only ever rises and says nothing
 * about which piece of work cost anything, whereas power lines up with the spikes on the memory and
 * network pages.
 *
 * @param updateInterval Milliseconds between samples.
 * @param source Where readings come from. Injectable so tests need no device.

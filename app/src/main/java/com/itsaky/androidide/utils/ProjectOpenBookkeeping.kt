/**
 * Marks [root] as the currently open project (singleton state + last-opened pref), records it in
 * Recents, and tracks the open in analytics -- the same bookkeeping
 * [com.itsaky.androidide.activities.MainActivity.openProject] does for a normal manual open,
 * extracted so a deep-link-triggered project switch gets it too even though that path bypasses
 * `openProject` entirely (see
 * [com.itsaky.androidide.activities.editor.EditorHandlerActivity.onDestroy]).
 *
 * [recentProjectRepository] is the caller's Koin-provided instance (`by inject()`) -- per ADR
 * 0001/0006, persistence is always acquired through Koin, never by re-deriving the database
 * directly, and kept behind this repository interface (not the raw DAO) so callers in the UI layer
 * (both [com.itsaky.androidide.activities.MainActivity] and
 * [com.itsaky.androidide.activities.editor.EditorHandlerActivity]) don't depend on a Room data
 * source directly, per ARCHITECTURE.md's UI -> ViewModel -> Repository -> data source layering.
 *
 * Uses [ProcessLifecycleOwner]'s scope rather than a per-activity one, since this can run from an
 * activity's `onDestroy()` after its own `lifecycleScope` has already been cancelled.

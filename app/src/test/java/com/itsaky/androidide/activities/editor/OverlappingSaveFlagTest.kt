/**
 * Overlapping saves must never leave `areFilesSaving` false while a save is still writing -
 * SaveFileAction re-enables itself off that flag, so a false gap lets the user fire a second
 * save into an in-flight write.
 *
 * The interleaving is forced, not timed. Robolectric's paused main looper holds the off-main
 * save's completion hop in the queue while the main-thread save runs its own hop inline
 * (`Main.immediate` skips the queue when already on main) - exactly the ordering inversion at
 * issue.
 *
 *  - BUGGED: the count moves off-main, so the finishing off-main save decrements to 0 and
 *    queues `false`; the main-thread save then sees 0 -> 1 and writes `true` inline; the
 *    queued `false` runs last -> flag false mid-save -> test FAILS.
 *  - FIXED: count and flag move together on main, so the queued decrement lands as 2 -> 1 and
 *    writes nothing -> flag stays true -> test PASSES.

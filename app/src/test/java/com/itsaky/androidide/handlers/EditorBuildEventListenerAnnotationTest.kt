/**
 * What the metrics charts annotate, and which build each annotation belongs to.
 *
 * Two decisions, both asserted against the function that makes them rather than through the
 * callback that acts on it -- those need a live activity before they get this far. Which progress
 * events are marked at all (ADFA-5486), and whether a build that failed was really the user
 * stopping it (ADFA-5542). The second is now a reading of what the server said rather than a
 * conclusion drawn on this side, so what is worth pinning is which answers are *not* a cancel.

/**
 * ADFA-5242: one failed accept() must not take documentation down for the rest of the session.
 *
 * `ServerSocket.accept()` is declared to throw `IOException`; `SocketException` is one subtype. The
 * loop used to catch only that subtype, and the enclosing try had a finally but no catch, so any
 * other `IOException` -- a descriptor-exhaustion "Too many open files", say -- unwound to
 * `start()`'s outermost handler, whose finally closes the listening socket *and* the database. Every
 * later request then failed until the app restarted, with one log line as the only trace.
 *
 * These drive the real loop through a socket whose accept() fails on demand. Stopping is decided
 * from socket state rather than the exception's message, so the scripted socket closes itself when it
 * means "stop" -- which is what a real `ServerSocket` does before accept() unblocks.

 * Pins where the sampling-rate chooser is reached from (ADFA-5486).
 *
 * The x axis is drawn by the chart rather than being a view of its own, so the tap is recognised by
 * comparing coordinates against the plot area. That test and the axis's position have to agree:
 * they disagreed once -- the axis at the bottom, the tap band at the top -- which left the only way
 * to change the sampling rate in an empty strip at the far end of the chart from the labels the
 * gesture is named for.

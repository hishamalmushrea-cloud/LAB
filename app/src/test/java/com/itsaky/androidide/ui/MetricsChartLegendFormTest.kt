/**
 * The legend marker is a small dot, and it stays one (ADFA-5553).
 *
 * The squares were 15dp and set per dataset, which crowded the label beside them and the axis
 * below. The size now comes from the legend, and that only works while no dataset overrides it:
 * `LegendRenderer` takes the dataset's `formSize` whenever it is not NaN and falls back to the
 * legend's only otherwise, so one renderer setting it again would silently take the setting back
 * without anything failing. That deference is what these tests pin -- asserting `legend.form` alone
 * would restate a setter and pass against the code this ticket exists to change.
 *
 * The size test runs at xhdpi on purpose. MPAndroidChart stores half of these properties in dp and
 * half in pixels, and at Robolectric's default density of 1.0 nothing tells the two apart.

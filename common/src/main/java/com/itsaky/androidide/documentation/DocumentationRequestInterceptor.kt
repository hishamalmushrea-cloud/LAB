 * this matches the same `http://localhost:6174/...` space the server listens on, which is what lets
 * the strings.xml entries, ToolTipManager's link builder, and the plugin API contract stay as they
 * are. Anything this returns null for -- a `/pr/` developer endpoint, an unknown path, a read that
 * fails -- falls through to that server unchanged.
 *
 * Templated pages included: [DocumentationContentSource] renders them, so every documentation path
 * a WebView asks for is answered here.

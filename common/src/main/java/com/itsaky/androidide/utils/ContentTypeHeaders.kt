/**
 * Turns a stored `ContentTypes.value` into the `Content-Type` a client should be sent.
 *
 * `documentation.db` stores bare MIME types -- no `ContentTypes.value` carries a charset -- so a
 * text response says nothing about its encoding, and a client that does not assume UTF-8 falls back
 * to a legacy single-byte encoding. 17,903 of the 29,139 text rows in the 21-Aug database --
 * 61.4%, a full census rather than a sample -- contain non-ASCII bytes with no BOM, so they render
 * as mojibake wherever that guess goes wrong (ADFA-5241): a page's U+21B3 arrow arriving as the
 * three Latin-1 characters its UTF-8 bytes decode to. (The rate is per-generation; an older export
 * measures far lower, so quote the database when quoting the number.)
 *
 * This is deliberately *not* fixed by storing the parameter in the database. `ContentTypes.value`
 * doubles as a lookup key matched exactly by the plugin installer
 * (`ExtensionToContentTypeResolver`), by `docdb-studio`'s anchor extraction, and by three scripts in
 * `OfflineDocumentationTools`; two of those would fail silently rather than loudly.
 *
 * Kept in `common` so both documentation transports answer the same way -- the socket server here
 * and ADFA-5176's `shouldInterceptRequest` interceptor, which otherwise carries its own rule.

/**
 * Decides whether a relative path is safely inside a base directory.
 *
 * Built for attacker-controllable input: the `{filename}` segment of a deep-link URL, and the entry
 * names in a zip. It lives in `common` because it is plain `java.io`/`java.nio` with no Android
 * dependency, so both the app and this module's own [ZipUtils] can call it. It replaces the copies
 * in [ZipUtils] and `AssetsInstallationHelper`, which had already drifted apart on the `..` rule.
 * Two hand-rolled containment checks remain unmigrated -- `ZipRecipeExecutor` and `PluginLoader`
 * (ADFA-5266) -- so this is not yet the only implementation in the tree.
 *
 * A `..` segment is rejected outright, which is stricter than the canonical-prefix check [ZipUtils]
 * used to apply: an entry like `a/../b.txt` normalizes back inside the base and used to extract, and
 * now fails the archive. That is a deliberate narrowing, matching what the asset installer already
 * enforced, and it fails loudly rather than silently.
 *
 * Three layers:
 * 1. A lexical reject of an empty string, a `..` *segment*, or a leading `/` or `\`. Per segment,
 *    not as a substring: `notes..txt` and `a..b/c.kt` are legitimate filenames, and only a literal
 *    `..` segment can name a parent directory, so nothing is lost.
 * 2. Resolve + normalize against the base and verify with [java.nio.file.Path.startsWith] (not
 *    string prefix matching, which would wrongly accept `/project` as inside `/project-evil`). This
 *    operates on Java's own resolved path, so it is not fooled by however `..` reached the string.
 * 3. Resolve the base and the nearest *existing* ancestor of that path to its real, on-disk path via
 *    [java.nio.file.Path.toRealPath] and re-verify containment -- layer 2 is purely lexical and
 *    will not catch a symlink already present inside the base (a project cloned with git, an
 *    installer directory reused across runs). Walking up to the nearest existing ancestor handles a
 *    path that does not exist yet. Containment is always judged against the base's *real* location,
 *    whether or not the base exists yet: a symlink between the base and the filesystem root is where
 *    the caller's base lives, not an escape from it, so a *confirmed-absent* base under such a link
 *    answers the same as the created one would (ADFA-5257 review). A base or ancestor that cannot be
 *    resolved is refused outright, never quietly downgraded to layer 2.
 *
 * What this deliberately does *not* decide is what to do about an existing symlink *at the target*
 * whose destination is still inside the base. The two callers disagree -- unzipping leaves a user's
 * own `gradlew` symlink alone, the asset installer refuses to write through any symlink -- so that
 * check stays visible at each call site rather than being buried here. Each caller applies it
 * *after* asking this class, so the check only ever sees a path already proven contained.
 *
 * Holds no state beyond the base directory, and verifies against the filesystem on every call --
 * see [resolve] for why it does not memoize what it has already proven.

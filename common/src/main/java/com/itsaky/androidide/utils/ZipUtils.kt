	 * `File.outputStream()` is a thin inline wrapper over it. [StandardOpenOption] plus
	 * [LinkOption.NOFOLLOW_LINKS] moves the refusal into the `open(2)` call itself (`O_NOFOLLOW`), so
	 * there is no window between deciding and doing.
	 *
	 * This closes the *final component* only. A symlink substituted for one of the parent directories
	 * is still followed, by `mkdirs()` above and by the open here, because resolving a path relative
	 * to an already-open directory needs `openat(2)`, which `java.nio` does not expose. Narrowing that
	 * further would mean JNI or a different extraction strategy; it is recorded rather than implied
	 * away (ADFA-5257 review).

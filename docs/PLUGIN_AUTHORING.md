# Plugin Authoring Guide

This is the canonical in-repo reference for authoring a Code on the Go
plugin. It covers project layout, the `AndroidManifest.xml` meta-data
contract, theme-aware icons, building, installing, and common failure
modes.

For higher-level architecture and product-side context, see the
[Plugin Development wiki page](https://appdevforall.atlassian.net/wiki/x/BQANIQ).

The closest in-tree example today is `apk-viewer-plugin/`. Note that
the existing sample plugins do **not** yet ship theme-aware icons — the
icon section below is the source of truth until they're updated.

## Project layout

A plugin is a standalone Android module that compiles to a `.cgp` file
(a renamed APK). Recommended layout:

```
my-plugin/
├── build.gradle.kts
├── proguard-rules.pro
├── settings.gradle.kts
└── src/main/
    ├── AndroidManifest.xml          # All plugin metadata lives here
    ├── assets/                      # Theme icons go here (PNG/WebP)
    │   ├── icon_day.png
    │   └── icon_night.png
    ├── kotlin/.../MyPlugin.kt       # Implements IPlugin
    └── res/                         # Standard Android resources (layouts, etc.)
        ├── layout/
        └── values/
```

The build is wired up by applying `com.itsaky.androidide.plugins.build`
in `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.android.application") version "8.8.2"
    id("org.jetbrains.kotlin.android") version "2.3.0"
    id("com.itsaky.androidide.plugins.build")
}

pluginBuilder {
    pluginName = "my-plugin"   // becomes my-plugin.cgp
    pluginVersion = "1.0.0"
}
```

### Depending on the plugin API

The IDE-side API your plugin compiles against ships as a Maven **coordinate**,
injected into the on-device local Maven repository during onboarding — so it
resolves offline, with no `libs/*.jar` to commit:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    compileOnly("com.itsaky.androidide:plugin-api:1.0.0")
}
```

`plugin-api:1.0.0` is a single jar bundling the API surface plugins compile
against — the `:plugin-api` module plus `common`, `eventbus-events`, and
`idetooltips`. The builder plugin applied above resolves the same way, from the
injected `com.itsaky.androidide.plugins.build` `1.0.0` marker.

#### Building on-device (offline) pins the AGP/Kotlin/Gradle versions

The `plugins {}` example above uses AGP `8.8.2` / Kotlin `2.3.0` — the versions the
dev/CI repo resolves online. A plugin built **on-device** resolves its build plugins from
the harvested on-device `localMvnRepository`, which ships only the versions pinned in
`org.adfa.constants` — `ANDROID_GRADLE_PLUGIN_VERSION`, `KOTLIN_VERSION` and
`GRADLE_DISTRIBUTION_VERSION`, currently **AGP `9.3.1`**, **Kotlin `2.3.21`** and
**Gradle `9.6.1`**. Request those, or offline resolution of the build plugins fails. That
constants file is authoritative; the numbers here are a snapshot of it.

AGP 9 compiles Kotlin itself and **refuses** the `org.jetbrains.kotlin.android` plugin, so
an on-device build drops it and pins Kotlin through the `kotlin-gradle-plugin` jar on the
**root** buildscript classpath, which is where AGP 9 takes its compiler from. Declare AGP
`apply false` in the same root file (as the standard CoGo project template does):

```kotlin
buildscript {
    dependencies {
        classpath("org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:2.3.21")
    }
}

plugins {
    id("com.android.application") apply false version "9.3.1"
    id("com.android.library") apply false version "9.3.1"
}
```

CoGo injects `LogSenderPlugin` (via its build init script) into every module; that
plugin references AGP's `ApplicationVariant` and is loaded from the root buildscript
classpath, so a root without AGP fails configuration with
`NoClassDefFoundError: com/android/build/api/variant/ApplicationVariant`.

> The in-app plugin-project detector still recognizes a project by a
> `libs/plugin-api.jar` on disk; dropping that on-disk requirement so a
> coordinate-only plugin is recognized is tracked in ADFA-4913.

## AndroidManifest meta-data reference

All plugin metadata is declared as `<meta-data>` tags inside
`<application>` in `src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`. The loader reads
these in `PluginLoader.getPluginMetadata()`
(`plugin-manager/src/main/kotlin/com/itsaky/androidide/plugins/manager/loaders/PluginLoader.kt`).

\* The loader supplies a default if the tag is absent, so the install
won't fail, but the plugin will be hard to identify in the UI.

To choose `plugin.min_ide_version`, see the
[Plugin API Changelog](PLUGIN_API_CHANGELOG.md) — it maps each plugin
capability to the `YY.WW` release that first shipped it.

Example (adapted from `apk-viewer-plugin/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`):

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <application
        android:label="My Plugin"
        android:theme="@style/PluginTheme">

        <meta-data android:name="plugin.id"              android:value="com.example.myplugin" />
        <meta-data android:name="plugin.name"            android:value="My Plugin" />
        <meta-data android:name="plugin.version"         android:value="${pluginVersion}" />
        <meta-data android:name="plugin.description"     android:value="One-line description." />
        <meta-data android:name="plugin.author"          android:value="Your Name" />
        <meta-data android:name="plugin.main_class"      android:value="com.example.myplugin.MyPlugin" />
        <meta-data android:name="plugin.min_ide_version" android:value="1.0.0" />
        <meta-data android:name="plugin.permissions"     android:value="filesystem.read" />
        <meta-data android:name="plugin.sidebar_items"   android:value="1" />

        <meta-data android:name="plugin.icon_day"        android:value="assets/icon_day.png" />
        <meta-data android:name="plugin.icon_night"      android:value="assets/icon_night.png" />

        <meta-data android:name="plugin.vcs_revision"    android:value="${pluginVcsRevision}" />
        <meta-data android:name="plugin.build_timestamp" android:value="${pluginBuildTimestamp}" />
    </application>
</manifest>
```

`extensions` and `build_actions` are not readable from
`AndroidManifest.xml` meta-data — they're only honored when supplied
via a `plugin.json` fallback manifest. If your plugin needs either,
use the JSON form (see `PluginManifest.kt`).

## Theme-aware icons

The plugin manager renders a different icon based on whether the system
is in light or dark mode (`PluginListItem.kt:69-70`). To opt in, ship
two raster icons in your plugin and point at them from the manifest.

### Where the files go

Put your icons in **`src/main/assets/`**:

```
src/main/assets/
├── icon_day.png
└── icon_night.png
```

**Do not** use `res/drawable/` or `res/raw/`. The loader does a
literal ZIP-entry lookup against the *compiled* `.cgp`
(`PluginLoader.kt:207`), and AAPT2 rewrites resource paths during the
build (vector XML becomes compiled binary XML; bitmaps may move to
density-qualified directories). Only `assets/<name>` is preserved
verbatim, so it's the only location where the path you write in the
manifest matches the path the loader will find.

### Supported formats

- **PNG** (recommended)
- **WebP**
- **JPEG**

**Not supported:** raw SVG, Android vector drawable XML (compiled or
not). Icons are decoded with `BitmapFactory` (`FileImage.kt:102`), which
handles raster formats only. Convert SVG sources to PNG yourself
before bundling.

### Recommended dimensions

96×96 px square. The plugin list renders icons at roughly 48dp, so
96 px covers xxxhdpi devices with headroom.

### Manifest declaration

```xml
<meta-data android:name="plugin.icon_day"
           android:value="assets/icon_day.png" />
<meta-data android:name="plugin.icon_night"
           android:value="assets/icon_night.png" />
```

The value is the literal path inside the `.cgp` ZIP, **not** an
Android resource reference. No `@drawable/...`, no leading slash.

### Debug builds must ship both icons

If your plugin is built with `assemblePluginDebug` (i.e. the resulting
APK has `FLAG_DEBUGGABLE`), the installer **rejects** the plugin
unless both `plugin.icon_day` and `plugin.icon_night` are declared
**and** both files are present inside the `.cgp`. The check is in
`PluginRepositoryImpl.kt:105`, and the error message is verbatim:

> `[<pluginId>] Missing <keys> for debug plugin. Debug plugins must declare and ship both icon_day and icon_night assets.`

The uploaded `.cgp` is deleted when this fires. Release builds may
omit icons; they fall back to the generic `ic_extension` puzzle-piece
drawable, tinted with `?attr/colorOnSurface` so it adapts to the
theme automatically.

### Runtime location (debugging only)

On install, both icons are extracted to a per-plugin directory on the
device:

```
/data/data/<app-id>/app_plugin_icons/<plugin-id>/icon_day.<ext>
/data/data/<app-id>/app_plugin_icons/<plugin-id>/icon_night.<ext>
```

Useful for confirming the install actually unpacked the files (see
[Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) below).

## Building & installing

From the repo root, with the flox environment active:

```bash
flox activate -d flox/local -- ./gradlew :my-plugin:assemblePlugin       # release
flox activate -d flox/local -- ./gradlew :my-plugin:assemblePluginDebug   # debug
```

Output:

- Release: `my-plugin/build/plugin/my-plugin.cgp`
- Debug:   `my-plugin/build/plugin/my-plugin-debug.cgp`

To install, transfer the `.cgp` to the device and use the in-app
plugin manager (Settings → Plugins → Install). The installer
validates the manifest, extracts icons, and registers the plugin.

## Provenance

Every `.cgp` records the commit it was built from, so a bug report can be
traced back to source. The builder resolves it once per build and publishes it
three ways: the two `meta-data` entries above, `assets/cgp-build.properties`
inside the archive, and the IDE's plugin details dialog.

```bash
unzip -p my-plugin/build/plugin/my-plugin.cgp assets/cgp-build.properties
```

```properties
name=my-plugin
version=1.0.0-release.20260901161500
variant=release
revision=737f8836b6ce
revision_source=git
timestamp=20260901161500
timestamp_source=commit
```

`revision_source` says how the revision was found, in the order the builder
tries them:

| Value               | Meaning                                                          |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `explicit`          | You set `pluginBuilder { pluginVcsRevision = "..." }`.            |
| `env:<VAR>`         | Read from `PLUGIN_VCS_REVISION`, `GITHUB_SHA`, `CI_COMMIT_SHA` or `GIT_COMMIT`. |
| `git`               | `git rev-parse` in the plugin directory.                          |
| `git-dir`           | Read out of `.git` directly. This is the on-device path -- Code on the Go ships JGit in-process, not a `git` binary. |
| `none`              | Nothing answered; `revision` is `unknown`.                        |

`revision` gains a `+dirty` suffix when the plugin's own directory has
uncommitted changes. The check is scoped to that directory, so unrelated dirt
elsewhere in the repository does not flag your build.

`timestamp` is the committer date of that revision, in UTC, so two builds of one
commit produce a byte-identical `.cgp`. When git cannot be reached the builder
falls back to the clock and says so with `timestamp_source=wall-clock` -- that
stamp also lands in the autogenerated version string, so a wall-clock build is
not reproducible. Building inside Code on the Go always takes that fallback: the
IDE embeds JGit rather than shipping a `git` binary, so it can read your commit
out of `.git` but not that commit's date.

If you distribute your plugin as a source archive rather than a repository,
`git archive` and tarballs carry no `.git`, so state the revision yourself:

```kotlin
pluginBuilder {
    pluginName = "my-plugin"
    pluginVcsRevision = "737f8836b6ce"
}
```

The record is always written, even when everything is unknown -- a file saying
`revision=unknown` is a definite statement, whereas a missing one is ambiguous
between an old builder, a community build, and tampering.

Reading back, the IDE treats a blank provenance value as an absent one, so a
hand-written `plugin.vcs_revision=""` shows no `Built From` row at all rather
than an empty one. Let the placeholder fill the value in and this never comes
up.

## Permissions

Declare permissions as a comma-separated list in `plugin.permissions`.
Defined by `PluginPermission` in `plugin-api/src/main/kotlin/com/itsaky/androidide/plugins/IPlugin.kt`:

| Key                      | Grants                                                                          |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `filesystem.read`        | Read files from the project directory                                           |
| `filesystem.write`       | Write files to the project directory                                            |
| `network.access`         | Access network resources                                                        |
| `system.commands`        | Execute system commands                                                         |
| `ide.settings`           | Modify IDE settings                                                             |
| `project.structure`      | Modify project structure                                                        |
| `native.code`            | Execute native machine code                                                     |
| `ide.environment.write`  | Write to IDE-managed directories (Android SDK, NDK, cache)                      |

## Troubleshooting

**Install fails with "Missing icon_day and icon_night for debug plugin"**

Your debug build is missing one or both icons. Check:
1. Both `<meta-data>` tags are present in `AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Both files exist in `src/main/assets/`.
3. After building, `unzip -l my-plugin/build/plugin/my-plugin-debug.cgp | grep assets`
   shows both `assets/icon_day.png` and `assets/icon_night.png`.

**Plugin lists shows the generic puzzle-piece icon instead of yours**

The loader couldn't find the file at the declared ZIP path. The
manifest value must match the actual path inside the `.cgp` byte-for-byte.

```bash
# Inspect what the manifest declares:
aapt2 dump xmltree my-plugin/build/plugin/my-plugin.cgp --file AndroidManifest.xml | grep icon_

# Inspect what's actually in the ZIP:
unzip -l my-plugin/build/plugin/my-plugin.cgp | grep -E 'assets|icon'
```

Common causes: typo in the manifest path, file accidentally placed
under `res/raw/` or `res/drawable/`, or a leading slash on the
manifest value (use `assets/icon_day.png`, not `/assets/icon_day.png`).

**Wrong icon shows for the current theme**

The selection happens in `PluginListItem.kt:69-70` via
`isSystemInDarkMode()`. Verify your device is actually in the theme
you expect (system Settings → Display). Also verify both files
extracted to the device:

```bash
adb shell run-as <your.app.id> ls app_plugin_icons/<plugin-id>/
```

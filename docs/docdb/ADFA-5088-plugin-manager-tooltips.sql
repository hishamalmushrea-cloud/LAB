-- ADFA-5088: Tooltips + Content rows for the Plugin Manager screen.
--
-- The Plugin Manager screen previously showed one shared tooltip
-- ("plugin.manager") for its toolbar, download icon, FAB, empty state,
-- and every plugin row. The corresponding code change replaces that
-- with a distinct TooltipTag per widget; this script adds the
-- documentation database rows those new tags look up.
--
-- None of the new tags below existed before. The old shared "plugin.manager"
-- tag (a different string from every tag below) is now dead - no code
-- references it any more - so this script deletes it, its one
-- TooltipButtons row, and the Content page that button was the only thing
-- pointing to (i/plugin-install.html) - verified via the real database
-- that no other TooltipButtons row or app code references that path.
--
-- Both Tooltips (UNIQUE(categoryId, tag)) and Content (UNIQUE(path)) are
-- idempotent `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE` upserts below, so the
-- whole script is safe to re-run.
--
-- All rows use categoryId = 1 ("ide"), languageId = 1 ("EN-us"),
-- contentTypeId = 12 ("text/html", brotli-compressed).
--
-- Apply against the real documentation.db:
--   sqlite3 documentation.db < ADFA-5088-plugin-manager-tooltips.sql
-- The whole script runs inside one transaction (BEGIN/COMMIT below) with
-- `.bail on`, so any failure - a bad SQL statement, or a Brotli payload
-- caught by the guard below - stops the script and leaves the database
-- untouched (the open transaction rolls back when the connection closes)
-- rather than half-applied.
--
-- Every Brotli payload is written under /tmp/adfa5088-pm-workdir, an
-- owner-only (mode 700) directory this script creates fresh and removes
-- again at the end of a successful run - not bare /tmp filenames, which
-- are guessable and world-writable, so another local user could pre-plant
-- a symlink or race the write/read pair (CWE-377). `mkdir -m` sets the
-- mode atomically at creation, and the preceding `rm -rf` means each run
-- starts from a directory it fully owns rather than trusting one left
-- over from an earlier run - including one left behind by a `.bail`
-- abort part-way through a previous run, since that skips the cleanup at
-- the end. Don't run two copies of this script at once against the same
-- database: both would share this one fixed workdir path.
--
-- For each Content row: `.system rm -f <workdir>/x.br` clears any stale
-- file, `.system echo "<html>" | brotli -Z > <workdir>/x.br` writes the
-- compressed payload (the uncompressed HTML is visible right there in
-- the command), then `INSERT INTO _content_guard SELECT
-- READFILE('<workdir>/x.br')` is a deliberate assertion: `.system`
-- failures aren't SQL errors and `.bail` can't see them directly, but a
-- failed or empty Brotli run leaves the file missing or empty, and
-- _content_guard's `NOT NULL` + `CHECK (length(content) > 0)` turn that
-- into a real SQL error `.bail` does catch - before the real `INSERT INTO
-- Content` below it can run with bad data. _content_guard is a TEMP
-- table: connection-local, dropped automatically, never touches the real
-- schema.
--
-- `.system`, `.bail`, and `READFILE()` require the sqlite3 CLI (not a
-- library binding). If `.system` is disabled in your sqlite3 build,
-- create the mode-700 working directory and run each `rm -f`/`echo ... |
-- brotli -Z > file` pair yourself via a shell first, then run just the
-- INSERT statements (the _content_guard assertion becomes redundant at
-- that point - the file either exists and is non-empty by the time you
-- run the script, or you'd have already seen the shell command fail).

.bail on
BEGIN;

-- A temp table (connection-local, never touches the real schema) whose
-- CHECK constraint turns a silently-empty or failed Brotli payload into a
-- real SQL error .bail can catch, before it ever reaches the real Content
-- table.
CREATE TEMP TABLE _content_guard (content BLOB NOT NULL CHECK (length(content) > 0));

-- Route every Brotli payload through an owner-only (mode 700) working
-- directory instead of bare /tmp filenames: a fixed name under world-
-- writable /tmp is guessable, so another local user could pre-plant a
-- symlink or race the write/read pair. mkdir -m sets the mode atomically
-- at creation (no separate chmod, no window with a wider mode); the prior
-- rm -rf makes each run start from a clean directory it fully owns,
-- rather than trusting one left over from an earlier run. mkdir can still
-- fail silently from .bail's perspective (e.g. another process recreates
-- the path between the rm -rf and the mkdir), so assert the directory's
-- permission string afterward - via `ls -ld | cut -c1-10`, not `stat`,
-- since stat's flag for this differs between GNU coreutils and BSD/macOS
-- (an earlier version used `stat --printf` and broke on macOS; `ls -l`'s
-- 10-character permission-string format is POSIX-specified and portable
-- to both). A dynamically-generated (mktemp-style) workdir name would
-- close this race more thoroughly, but doesn't fit this script: each
-- `.system` line is its own subshell, so a name it generates can't be
-- carried into later `.system`/READFILE() calls without writing it to
-- another fixed, guessable file first - the same class of problem.
.system rm -rf /tmp/adfa5088-pm-workdir
.system mkdir -m 700 /tmp/adfa5088-pm-workdir
.system ls -ld /tmp/adfa5088-pm-workdir | cut -c1-10 > /tmp/adfa5088-pm-workdir/.mode
-- `cut` (like `ls`) always emits a trailing newline, so the guard compares
-- against 'drwx------' + LF, not the bare 10-char string.
CREATE TEMP TABLE _workdir_guard (mode TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (mode = 'drwx------' || char(10)));
INSERT INTO _workdir_guard SELECT CAST(READFILE('/tmp/adfa5088-pm-workdir/.mode') AS TEXT);

-- Remove the dead "plugin.manager" tag: no code path can reach it any
-- more now that every widget has its own tag. Delete the TooltipButtons
-- row first (it references Tooltips.id via a foreign key). Its uri,
-- i/plugin-install.html, is the *only* TooltipButtons row that ever
-- pointed there (verified against the real database) and it isn't
-- referenced from app code or any other Content row either, so it
-- becomes genuinely unreachable once this row is gone - delete that
-- Content row too rather than leaving an orphan behind.

-- The plugin.manager rows and their i/plugin-install.html page STAY.
--
-- This block used to delete them, on the premise that the granular tags below replace the single
-- screen-level tag and nothing reaches it any more. That premise stopped being true when ADFA-4928
-- rewrote the Plugin Manager in Compose: ManagerScreen and PluginManagerContent both show
-- TooltipTag.PLUGIN_MANAGER, anchored on the root view, and they are the only plugin-manager
-- tooltips the app currently has -- the granular tags below are seeded ahead of a UI that can
-- anchor them (see TooltipTag.kt). Deleting the row would blank the one tooltip that works and
-- take its Tier 3 page with it, irreversibly, in the production database.

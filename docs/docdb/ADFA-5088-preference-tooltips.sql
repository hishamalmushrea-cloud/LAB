-- ADFA-5088: Tooltips + Content rows for every Preferences menu item.
--
-- Deliverable 1 (already merged) tags every Preferences row with its own
-- idetooltips TooltipTag.PREFS_* constant. This script fills in the
-- documentation database rows those tags look up: a Tooltips row per tag
-- (Tier 1 `summary` + Tier 2 `detail`) and a matching Content row (Tier 3
-- HTML page) at a new, item-granular `i/prefs/...` path.
--
-- Deliberately NOT included: prefs.general, prefs.editor, prefs.editor.xml,
-- prefs.termux, and prefs.git already exist in the real documentation.db
-- with a real (non-empty) summary -- these tags are reused as-is for the
-- corresponding screen/toolbar row, so this script leaves them alone rather
-- than overwriting curated production content with a draft. (Two of the
-- five have an empty Tier 2 detail; that's an existing, summary-only state
-- for those tags, not something this script introduces or needs to fix.)
-- prefs.top, by contrast, IS seeded below: this PR introduces the tag (the
-- Preferences toolbar/screen fallback), so no curated row exists yet.
--
-- Both Tooltips (UNIQUE(categoryId, tag)) and Content (UNIQUE(path)) are
-- idempotent `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE` upserts below, so the
-- whole script is safe to re-run.
--
-- All rows use categoryId = 1 ("ide"), languageId = 1 ("EN-us"),
-- contentTypeId = 12 ("text/html", brotli-compressed).
--
-- Apply against the real documentation.db:
--   sqlite3 documentation.db < ADFA-5088-preference-tooltips.sql
-- The whole script runs inside one transaction (BEGIN/COMMIT below) with
-- `.bail on`, so any failure - a bad SQL statement, or a Brotli payload
-- caught by the guard below - stops the script and leaves the database
-- untouched (the open transaction rolls back when the connection closes)
-- rather than half-applied.
--
-- Every Brotli payload is written under /tmp/adfa5088-prefs-workdir, an
-- owner-only (mode 700) directory this script creates fresh and removes
-- again at the end of a successful run - not bare /tmp filenames, which
-- are guessable and world-writable, so another local user could pre-plant
-- a symlink or race the write/read pair (CWE-377). `mkdir -m` sets the
-- mode atomically at creation, and the preceding `rm -rf` means each run
-- starts from a directory it fully owns rather than trusting one left
-- over from an earlier run - including one left behind by a `.bail`
-- abort part-way through a previous run, since that skips the cleanup at
-- the end. Don't run two copies of this script at once against the same
-- database: both would share this one fixed workdir path.
--
-- For each Content row: `.system rm -f <workdir>/x.br` clears any stale
-- file, `.system echo "<html>" | brotli -Z > <workdir>/x.br` writes the
-- compressed payload (the uncompressed HTML is visible right there in
-- the command), then `INSERT INTO _content_guard SELECT
-- READFILE('<workdir>/x.br')` is a deliberate assertion: `.system`
-- failures aren't SQL errors and `.bail` can't see them directly, but a
-- failed or empty Brotli run leaves the file missing or empty, and
-- _content_guard's `NOT NULL` + `CHECK (length(content) > 0)` turn that
-- into a real SQL error `.bail` does catch - before the real `INSERT INTO
-- Content` below it can run with bad data. _content_guard is a TEMP
-- table: connection-local, dropped automatically, never touches the real
-- schema.
--
-- `.system`, `.bail`, and `READFILE()` require the sqlite3 CLI (not a
-- library binding). If `.system` is disabled in your sqlite3 build,
-- create the mode-700 working directory and run each `rm -f`/`echo ... |
-- brotli -Z > file` pair yourself via a shell first, then run just the
-- INSERT statements (the _content_guard assertion becomes redundant at
-- that point - the file either exists and is non-empty by the time you
-- run the script, or you'd have already seen the shell command fail).

.bail on
BEGIN;

-- A temp table (connection-local, never touches the real schema) whose
-- CHECK constraint turns a silently-empty or failed Brotli payload into a
-- real SQL error .bail can catch, before it ever reaches the real Content
-- table.
CREATE TEMP TABLE _content_guard (content BLOB NOT NULL CHECK (length(content) > 0));

-- Route every Brotli payload through an owner-only (mode 700) working
-- directory instead of bare /tmp filenames: a fixed name under world-
-- writable /tmp is guessable, so another local user could pre-plant a
-- symlink or race the write/read pair. mkdir -m sets the mode atomically
-- at creation (no separate chmod, no window with a wider mode); the prior
-- rm -rf makes each run start from a clean directory it fully owns,
-- rather than trusting one left over from an earlier run. mkdir can still
-- fail silently from .bail's perspective (e.g. another process recreates
-- the path between the rm -rf and the mkdir), so assert the directory's
-- permission string afterward - via `ls -ld | cut -c1-10`, not `stat`,
-- since stat's flag for this differs between GNU coreutils and BSD/macOS
-- (an earlier version used `stat --printf` and broke on macOS; `ls -l`'s
-- 10-character permission-string format is POSIX-specified and portable
-- to both). A dynamically-generated (mktemp-style) workdir name would
-- close this race more thoroughly, but doesn't fit this script: each
-- `.system` line is its own subshell, so a name it generates can't be
-- carried into later `.system`/READFILE() calls without writing it to
-- another fixed, guessable file first - the same class of problem.

.system ls -ld /tmp/adfa5088-prefs-workdir | cut -c1-10 > /tmp/adfa5088-prefs-workdir/.mode

-- Neither this script nor the sibling plugin-manager one inserts the 5 tags
-- below (see "Deliberately NOT included" above) - they're assumed to
-- already exist in the real database with a real summary. A missing tag
-- makes the tooltipId subquery in the TooltipButtons block below return
-- NULL, and TooltipButtons has no NOT NULL/enforced FK on that column, so a
-- wrong assumption would silently insert a dead row instead of failing
-- loudly. Assert existence and a non-empty summary for all 5 (not detail
-- too - two of the five have an empty Tier 2 detail in the real database
-- today, which is an existing summary-only state, not a broken one).
-- prefs.top is NOT asserted here: it's new in this PR, seeded by the upsert
-- at the top of the Tooltips block above.

 *
 * Order: [INDEXING] < [DIAGNOSTICS] < [COMMAND] < [INTERACTIVE] — keystroke-driven requests
 * (completion, signature help) beat user-invoked commands, which beat background diagnostics, which
 * beat bulk indexing.
 *
 * [supersedesSamePriority] additionally lets a *newer* request preempt an in-flight one of the
 * **same** priority. On for [INTERACTIVE] only: rapid typing makes the in-flight request stale, so
 * the newer one cancels it and the superseded work is *discarded* (nothing reschedules it). Off for
 * the rest, whose preempted work is re-queued — there same-priority preemption would livelock, two

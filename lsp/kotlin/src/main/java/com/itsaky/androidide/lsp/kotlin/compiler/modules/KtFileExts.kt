/**
 * Runs [action] while holding the global analysis lock at the given [priority].
 *
 * The Analysis API keeps per-thread `analyze` lifetime state and is unsafe to drive concurrently;
 * indexing, diagnostics and completion all analyze on `Dispatchers.Default` and often target the same
 * file, so overlapping `analyze` calls corrupted the session lifecycle
 * (`KaInaccessibleLifetimeOwnerAccessException: ... Called outside an \`analyze\` context.`).
 * [AnalysisScheduler] serializes access; it is priority-aware, preemptive (via [cancelChecker]) and
 * reentrant. **All** Analysis API access must go through this helper (or [analyzeMaybeDangling]); never
 * call `analyze` / `analyzeCopy` directly, or the serialization guarantee is lost. That much is still
 * convention - both are public Analysis API functions this module cannot gate. What *is* enforced is the
 * step after: [analyzeMaybeDangling] requires opting in to [UnpinnedAnalysis], so analysing PSI that did
 * not come from a pin is a compile error until someone says so explicitly.
 *
 * **Cancellation.** [action] runs with a [kotlinx.coroutines.Job] installed in the thread's IntelliJ
 * context; the compiler's dense `checkCanceled()` calls throw once that Job is cancelled, aborting
 * *mid*-`analyze` rather than only at the coarse [ScheduledCancelChecker.abortIfCancelled] checkpoints
 * (a [CancelCheckerProgressIndicator] is installed as a fallback). On [ProcessCanceledException] we
 * re-derive the typed exception callers expect ([AnalysisPreemptedException] when preempted, else the
 * delegate's `CancellationException`) so preempted work is rescheduled, not silently dropped.
 *
 * **Footgun:** analysis holds the *read* side of the non-upgradeable
 * [com.itsaky.androidide.lsp.kotlin.compiler.read] lock, so code inside an `analyze` block must never
 * call [com.itsaky.androidide.lsp.kotlin.compiler.write] — read → write on the same thread deadlocks.

/**
 * Registry through which plugins contribute tools to the IDE's AI agent.
 *
 * <p>
 * The registry itself is implemented by the plugin that owns the agent (ai-core) and published under this type in {@link SharedServices}; the host defines the contract only. A contributing plugin resolves the registry on {@code activate()}, registers a {@link ToolSource}, and unregisters on {@code deactivate()} -- the same lifecycle a model backend follows with {@link LlmInferenceService#registerBackend}. When the agent plugin is not installed the lookup returns null and a provider registers nothing, which is the same clean degradation the backends already rely on.
 *
 * <p>
 * Values crossing this boundary must be JDK types ({@code String}, {@code Boolean}, {@code Integer}, {@code Double}, {@code List}, {@code Map}). Each plugin is loaded by its own class loader with the host as parent, so a class packaged in one {@code .cgp} is not resolvable from another; only types loaded by the host -- this interface and the JDK -- are common ground. A type duplicated into each plugin instead compiles cleanly and then fails on device with {@code ClassCastException}, because each loader defines its own copy.
 *
 * <p>
 * Every member here is an interface rather than a value class on purpose: {@code plugin-api} is additive-only, and adding a property to a class removes the constructor signature already-published plugins were built against. Java {@code default} methods let this contract grow without touching an implementor. The cost is a small concrete class on each side.
 */

Version compatibility is enforced where the loader already enforces it, by {@code plugin.min_ide_version} in the plugin manifest.

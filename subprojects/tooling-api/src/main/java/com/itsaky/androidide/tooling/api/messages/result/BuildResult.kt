	 * `null` on a successful build, which this type also carries. On a failed one this server
	 * always fills it in -- `notifyBuildFailure` classifies the throwable and returns a
	 * non-null [TaskExecutionResult.Failure], and both catch paths go through it -- so a client
	 * seeing `null` here alongside a failure is talking to a server that does not classify, not
	 * to this one. Nullable on the wire for exactly that case.
	 *
	 * The server is the only party that can answer this: Gradle raises a
	 * `BuildCancelledException` for a build the user stopped, and the same throwable that decides
	 * the [TaskExecutionResult] decides this. Without it a client had to reconstruct "was that a
	 * cancel?" from the order its own callbacks happened to arrive in, and got it wrong
	 * (ADFA-5542).
